## Ready for Production

The sandboxed agent system is **READY FOR PRODUCTION USE** with the following capabilities:

1. **Safe Task Execution**: All operations are sandboxed and size-limited
2. **Comprehensive Toolset**: 10 carefully selected tools for common tasks
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful failure handling and recovery
4. **Security First**: Multiple layers of security controls
5. **Extensive Testing**: Comprehensive test suite included
6. **Complete Documentation**: Ready-to-use documentation and examples

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: The system can be used as-is for safe task automation
2. **Short-term**: Add more tools as needed (following the documented process)
3. **Long-term**: Consider multi-agent capabilities and advanced features

## Notes
