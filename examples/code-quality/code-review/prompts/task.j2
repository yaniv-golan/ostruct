Review the following code files and provide a structured analysis that follows the JSON schema format.

## Code Files for Review
Analyze the code in {{ file_ref("code") }}.

For each file, analyze:

1. Issues and Problems:
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Code quality concerns
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Documentation gaps
   - Reliability risks
   - Dependency issues

2. Code Metrics:
   - Overall maintainability (high/medium/low)
   - Documentation quality (good/needs_improvement/poor)

For each issue, provide:
- Severity level (high/medium/low)
- Category (security/performance/maintainability/reliability/style/documentation/testing/dependencies)
- Description of the problem
- Line number(s) affected
- Relevant code snippet
- Specific recommendation for improvement

Provide your analysis in a format that matches this structure exactly:
