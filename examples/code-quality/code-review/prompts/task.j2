Review the following code files and provide a structured analysis that follows the JSON schema format. For each file, analyze:

1. Issues and Problems:
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Code quality concerns
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Documentation gaps
   - Reliability risks
   - Dependency issues

2. Code Metrics:
   - Cyclomatic complexity
   - Cognitive complexity
   - Overall maintainability (high/medium/low)
   - Documentation quality (good/needs_improvement/poor)

For each issue, provide:
- Severity level (high/medium/low)
- Category (security/performance/maintainability/reliability/style/documentation/testing/dependencies)
- Description of the problem
- Line number(s) affected
- Relevant code snippet
- Specific recommendation for improvement

Files to review:

{% for file in code %}
## File: {{ file.path }}

{{ file.content }}

{% endfor %}

Provide your analysis in a format that matches this structure:
