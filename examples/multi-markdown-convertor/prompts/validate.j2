# Conversion Output Validation

## Original Document Analysis

The original document had these characteristics:
{{ original_analysis }}

## Expected Content Checklist

Based on the analysis, please verify the following elements are present and properly converted:

{% if original_analysis.page_count %}
- [ ] Document has approximately {{ original_analysis.page_count }} pages worth of content
{% endif %}

{% if original_analysis.has_tables %}
- [ ] Tables are present and properly formatted as markdown tables (expected: {{ original_analysis.table_count | default("multiple") }} tables)
{% endif %}

{% if original_analysis.has_images %}
- [ ] Images are included with proper `![alt](path)` markdown syntax (expected: {{ original_analysis.image_count | default("multiple") }} images)
{% endif %}

{% if original_analysis.has_clear_headers %}
- [ ] Headers and document structure are preserved with proper markdown heading levels
{% endif %}

{% if original_analysis.has_footnotes %}
- [ ] Footnotes or endnotes are converted and linked appropriately
{% endif %}

{% if original_analysis.has_lists %}
- [ ] Lists (bullet and numbered) maintain proper nesting and formatting
{% endif %}

## Validation Tasks

Please perform a thorough validation of the converted output:

1. **Content Completeness Check**:
   - Compare against the checklist above
   - Identify any missing sections, pages, or content types
   - Note if any content appears truncated or cut off

2. **Formatting Fidelity Assessment**:
   - Check if tables are properly formatted (not converted to images or plain text)
   - Verify list indentation and nesting levels
   - Ensure headers maintain hierarchical structure
   - Confirm images have proper references and captions

3. **Integration Error Detection**:
   - Look for placeholder text (e.g., `<>`, `TODO`, `[PLACEHOLDER]`)
   - Check for incomplete markdown syntax or broken formatting
   - Identify any obvious merge artifacts or duplicated content
   - Detect half-rendered markup or HTML tags that shouldn't be there
   - Look for file path references that weren't properly converted

4. **Structural Anomaly Check**:
   - Verify no content appears out of order
   - Check for proper section breaks and transitions
   - Ensure no floating or orphaned content blocks

## Output Requirements

Provide a detailed validation report with:

1. **Overall Assessment**: Success/failure determination
2. **Quality Score**: 1-10 rating with justification
3. **Enumerated Issues List**:
   - List each issue as a separate, specific point
   - Include location references (section, page, or line if possible)
   - Categorize by severity (critical, major, minor)

   Example format:
   ```
   - CRITICAL: Table 2 from page 5 is completely missing
   - MAJOR: Bullet list nesting in Section 3.2 is flattened (was 3 levels, now 1)
   - MINOR: Image "diagram.png" caption formatting is inconsistent
   ```

4. **Specific Recommendations**: For each issue, suggest how it could be fixed
