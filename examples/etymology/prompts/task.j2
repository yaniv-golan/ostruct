# Etymology Analysis for "{{ word }}"

Given the word "{{ word }}", analyze its etymology and provide a nested breakdown of its components. Include:
- The complete word
- Each component's origin language
- The meaning of each component
- Any nested etymological relationships, including parallel components

Note: Each component must be an exact substring of the original word or its parent component.

The response should follow this exact structure:
```json
{
  "word": "{{ word }}",
  "etymology": {
    "component": "", // The complete word or major component
    "originLanguage": "", // Language of origin for this part
    "meaning": "", // Original meaning of this component
    "order": 1,
    "children": [ // Optional array of nested components
      {
        "component": "", // First child component (exact substring)
        "originLanguage": "", // Its language of origin
        "meaning": "", // Its meaning
        "order": 1,
        "children": [] // Further nesting if needed
      },
      {
        "component": "", // Second child component (exact substring)
        "originLanguage": "", // Its language of origin
        "meaning": "", // Its meaning
        "order": 2,
        "children": [] // Further nesting if needed
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

For example, for the word "automobile", the output would be:
```json
{
  "word": "automobile",
  "etymology": {
    "component": "automobile",
    "originLanguage": "French",
    "meaning": "self-moving vehicle",
    "order": 1,
    "children": [
      {
        "component": "auto",
        "originLanguage": "Greek",
        "meaning": "self",
        "order": 1,
        "children": []
      },
      {
        "component": "mobile",
        "originLanguage": "Latin",
        "meaning": "moving",
        "order": 2,
        "children": []
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Please break down the word into its etymological components, showing how each part evolved and contributed to the final meaning. Ensure each component includes:
1. The specific component (must be an exact substring of its parent)
2. Its language of origin
3. Its original meaning
4. The order of appearance in the parent word (1-based)
5. Any nested or parallel relationships to other components

The output must strictly follow the JSON schema provided.
