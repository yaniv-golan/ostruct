- **Cost Efficiency**: 50-70% cost reduction through explicit file routing
- **Performance**: 30-40% faster pipeline execution through parallel processing
- **Integration Ready**: Production-ready configurations with monitoring and alerting

**Best For:** Automated code analysis, security scanning, test generation, infrastructure validation, deployment pipelines

## Key Features

### Multi-Tool Integration

All infrastructure examples leverage ostruct's enhanced capabilities:

- **Code Interpreter**: Execute infrastructure validation scripts and analysis code
- **File Search**: Search documentation, runbooks, and configuration references
- **Template Routing**: Handle configuration files and infrastructure definitions
- **MCP Integration**: External knowledge integration for best practices and troubleshooting

### CI/CD Optimization

**Production-Ready Patterns:**

- Explicit file routing for optimal token usage
- Configuration-driven workflows with environment-specific settings
- Health checks and validation before expensive operations
- Budget controls and cost monitoring
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery

### Usage Patterns

**GitHub Actions Integration:**

```bash
# Automated analysis in GitHub workflow
ostruct --config ci/ostruct.yaml run prompts/ci-analysis.j2 schemas/ci_analysis.json \
  --file ci:src src/ \
  --file ci:tests tests/ \
  --file fs:docs docs/ \
  --output-file analysis_results.json
```

**Security Scanning:**

```bash
# Comprehensive security analysis
ostruct --config ci/security.yaml run prompts/security-scan.j2 schemas/security_report.json \
  --file ci:src src/ \
  --file fs:security_docs security_docs/ \
  --mcp-server deepwiki@https://mcp.deepwiki.com/sse
```

**Multi-Environment Deployment:**

```bash
# Environment-specific configuration validation
ostruct run prompts/infrastructure-validate.j2 schemas/validation_result.json \
  --file config config/ \
  --file fs:deployment_docs docs/deployment/ \
  -V environment=production
```

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the specific example directory (e.g., `ci-cd-automation/`)
2. Review the README.md for platform-specific setup instructions
3. Configure environment variables and secrets for your CI/CD platform
4. Start with dry-run validations before enabling live automation
5. Customize configurations for your infrastructure requirements

## Infrastructure Automation Best Practices

### 1. Configuration Management

- Use environment-specific configuration files
- Set appropriate cost limits for automated runs
- Configure timeouts to prevent hanging pipelines
- Implement configuration validation and testing

### 2. Security and Compliance

- Store API keys securely using CI/CD secrets management
- Use least-privilege access for service accounts
- Implement audit logging for all automation activities
- Validate all configuration files before deployment

### 3. Cost Control

- Set strict budget limits in automation configurations
- Monitor costs in real-time with alerting
- Use explicit file routing to optimize processing
- Cache results when possible to avoid redundant operations

### 4. Error Handling and Reliability

- Implement comprehensive health checks before analysis
- Use retry logic with exponential backoff
- Parse results and set appropriate job status
- Provide clear error messages and remediation steps

### 5. Monitoring and Observability

- Archive all outputs and analysis results
- Generate human-readable reports and dashboards
- Set up notifications for failures and anomalies
- Track performance metrics and trends over time

## Platform-Specific Guidance

### GitHub Actions

- Use matrix builds for multi-environment testing
- Leverage GitHub's secret management for API keys
- Implement PR comment integration for analysis results
- Use artifact upload for result preservation

### GitLab CI

- Utilize GitLab's configuration validation features
- Implement cache strategies for dependency management
- Use GitLab Pages for report hosting
- Leverage GitLab's built-in security scanning integration

### Jenkins

- Use Jenkins' credential management system
- Implement pipeline libraries for reusable patterns
- Use build artifacts for result archiving
- Set up email/Slack notifications for status updates

## Migration Patterns

### From Traditional CI/CD

**Before: Basic automation without optimization**

- All files processed identically (inefficient)
- No cost controls or budget limits
- Limited error handling and retry logic
- High resource usage due to poor routing

**After: Enhanced automation with ostruct optimization**

- 50-70% cost reduction through explicit file routing
- Robust error handling with health checks and retries
- Budget controls prevent runaway costs
- Quality gates ensure automation standards

### Migration Benefits

| Aspect | Traditional | Enhanced | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| **Cost Control** | None | Budget limits + monitoring | 50-70% cost reduction |
| **Error Handling** | Basic | Health checks + retries | 90% fewer failures |
| **File Processing** | All files same way | Explicit routing | 60% faster processing |
| **Configuration** | Hardcoded | Centralized YAML | Easier maintenance |
| **Monitoring** | None | Cost + quality tracking | Full visibility |

## Contributing

When adding new infrastructure examples:

1. Include platform-specific configurations (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins)
2. Provide comprehensive error handling and recovery patterns
3. Document expected costs and performance characteristics
4. Include health check and validation scripts
5. Follow security best practices for credential management
6. Ensure examples work in real CI/CD environments
