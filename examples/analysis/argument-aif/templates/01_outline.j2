You are an expert document analyst tasked with creating a structured outline of an argumentative document.

# Document Analysis Task

Analyze the provided document and create a hierarchical outline that identifies:
- Main argumentative sections
- Key claim transitions
- Logical structure boundaries
- Problem-solution patterns

## Document Content
{{ doc.content }}

## Instructions

1. **Section Identification**: Identify distinct sections based on:
   - **Argumentative Structure**: Main claims, supporting evidence, counterarguments
   - **Rhetorical Patterns**: Problem statement, proposed solution, examples, conclusions
   - **Topic Transitions**: Shifts in subject matter or argumentative focus
   - **Logical Flow Changes**: Cause-effect, comparison, chronological progression
   - **Headers and subheaders** (if present)

2. **Character Position Tracking**: For each section, provide:
   - Exact start character position (count from beginning of document)
   - Exact end character position
   - Section level (1-6)

3. **Quality Assessment**: Estimate complexity (1-10) for each section based on:
   - Argument density and sophistication
   - Number of claims and relationships
   - Technical or conceptual complexity

## Special Guidelines for Argumentative Documents

- **Look for key phrases** that signal argument structure: "therefore", "however", "my question", "I propose", "for example", "in conclusion"
- **Identify the main thesis or proposal** and treat it as a central section
- **Separate problem description from solution proposal**
- **Group related examples and evidence together**
- **Ensure each section contains complete argumentative units** (not cut mid-sentence)

## Output Requirements

Provide a structured outline with sections ordered sequentially. Each section must have:
- Unique ID (section_001, section_002, etc.)
- Descriptive title that captures the argumentative function
- Exact character boundaries (ensure complete sentences/paragraphs)
- Hierarchical level
- Complexity estimate

**CRITICAL**: Ensure character boundaries fall at natural breaks (end of sentences or paragraphs) to avoid cutting arguments mid-thought.

Focus on creating sections that contain coherent argument clusters suitable for detailed analysis.
