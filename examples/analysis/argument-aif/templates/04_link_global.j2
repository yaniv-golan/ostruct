You are an expert in argument analysis tasked with identifying global relationships across a unified argument graph.

# Global Relationship Analysis

Analyze the synthesized argument graph to identify missing cross-document relationships and strengthen the overall argumentative structure.

## Current Graph Structure

{{ graph.content }}

## Analysis Tasks

1. **Cross-Section Relationships**:
   - Identify nodes from different sections that should be connected
   - Look for implicit support/attack relationships
   - Find thematic connections across document boundaries

2. **Argument Chain Completion**:
   - Identify incomplete argument chains
   - Connect premises to conclusions across sections
   - Strengthen weak argumentative paths

3. **Semantic Clustering**:
   - Group semantically related nodes
   - Identify conceptual hierarchies
   - Find recurring themes and patterns

4. **Contradiction Detection**:
   - Identify potential conflicts between distant nodes
   - Flag logical inconsistencies
   - Suggest resolution strategies

## Enhancement Guidelines

- **Conservative Addition**: Only add relationships with high confidence (>0.7)
- **Evidence-Based**: Ensure all new relationships have textual support
- **Bidirectional Analysis**: Consider both directions for each potential relationship
- **Strength Calibration**: Assign appropriate strength scores based on evidence

## Output Requirements

Provide:
- Enhanced graph with new global relationships
- Relationship strength justifications
- Semantic cluster assignments
- Global coherence assessment
- Recommended graph improvements

Focus on enhancing the graph's analytical value while maintaining argumentative accuracy based on the actual graph content provided above.
