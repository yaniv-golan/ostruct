# Climate Change and Economic Policy

## Introduction

Climate change represents one of the most significant challenges facing modern society. The scientific consensus indicates that human activities, particularly greenhouse gas emissions, are the primary drivers of recent global warming trends.

## Economic Implications

The economic costs of climate change are substantial. Studies suggest that unmitigated climate change could reduce global GDP by 10-20% by 2100. However, the costs of mitigation are significantly lower, typically estimated at 1-3% of GDP annually.

## Policy Responses

Governments have implemented various policy responses including carbon pricing, renewable energy subsidies, and emissions regulations. Carbon pricing mechanisms have shown effectiveness in reducing emissions while generating revenue for green investments.

## Conclusion

The evidence strongly supports immediate action on climate change. The economic benefits of early action outweigh the costs of delay, making climate policy both an environmental and economic imperative.
