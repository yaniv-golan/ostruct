# Industry Taxonomy Classification - Pass 2

I need to add industry classification to the existing company data. The taxonomy reference has been uploaded to File Search for semantic analysis.

## Company Data to Classify:

**Company:** {{ core_data.company_name }}

**Summary:** {{ core_data.summary }}

**Business Model:** {{ core_data.business_model | default("Not specified") }}

**Market Size:** {{ core_data.market_size | default("Not specified") }}

## Classification Task:

Using the industry taxonomy reference available via File Search, I need to classify this company according to the hierarchy:

1. **Sector** (required) - Top-level classification
2. **Industry Group** (required) - Second-level classification within the sector
3. **Industry** (optional) - Specific industry within the group
4. **Vertical** (optional) - Cross-industry theme or specialization
5. **Emerging Spaces** (optional) - Array of relevant emerging technology categories

**Taxonomy Reference:** The complete industry taxonomy is available via File Search at {{ taxonomy.path }}

**Classification Guidelines:**
- Use exact taxonomy labels from the reference file
- Ensure sector and industry_group are consistent with the hierarchy
- Select the most specific and accurate classifications
- Include relevant emerging spaces that match the company's technology focus
- If multiple classifications could apply, choose the most specific one

**Example Query Patterns:**
- "What sector and industry group would a [company type] company belong to?"
- "What emerging spaces are relevant for [technology/business model]?"
- "What industry classification best matches [company description]?"

Return the classification in the JSON format specified by the schema.
