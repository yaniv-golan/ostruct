# Multi-Tool Routing Test

I need to test that the pitch deck file is accessible through both Code Interpreter and File Search.

## Test 1: Code Interpreter Access

Please use Code Interpreter to:
1. Read the uploaded file: {{ deck.name }}
2. Count the number of lines
3. Extract the company name from the first line

## Test 2: File Search Access

Please use File Search to:
1. Search for information about "funding" or "investment"
2. Search for team or founder information
3. Confirm the file is accessible for semantic search

## Expected Output

Return a JSON object with this structure:
```json
{
  "code_interpreter_test": {
    "file_accessible": true/false,
    "line_count": number,
    "company_name": "extracted name"
  },
  "file_search_test": {
    "file_accessible": true/false,
    "funding_info_found": true/false,
    "team_info_found": true/false
  },
  "routing_success": true/false
}
```
