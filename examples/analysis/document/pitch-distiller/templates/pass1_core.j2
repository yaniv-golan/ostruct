  - The PDF file has been uploaded directly for native OpenAI analysis
  - Use your vision and document understanding capabilities to analyze the content
  - Follow the exact JSON schema provided
  - Provide confidence scores for extracted information
  - Handle missing data gracefully with null values
  - This works with both text-based and image-based PDFs

# Pitch Deck Analysis - Pass 1: Core Data Extraction

I need to analyze the uploaded pitch deck and extract key information into a structured format. The document has been uploaded directly for native PDF analysis.

The document file: {{ deck.name }} ({{ deck.size }} bytes){% if deck.is_url %} from URL{% endif %}

I'll analyze the PDF content directly using native document understanding capabilities. I need to extract:

**Required Fields:**
- Company name and summary
- Funding ask details (amount, stage, use of funds)
- Founders information (names, roles, backgrounds)
- Extraction metadata with confidence scoring

**Optional Fields:**
- Company website (explicit or inferred from emails)
- Tagline
- Market size information
- Business model

**Special Instructions:**
- Analyze all slides/pages for comprehensive information extraction
- If no website is explicitly mentioned, look for founder email addresses and infer the company website from non-generic email domains that match the company name
- Redact any personal information (emails, phone numbers, addresses) for privacy
- Provide confidence scores based on data quality, completeness, and visual clarity
- Works with both text-based and image-based PDFs using native OpenAI capabilities

**Analysis Approach:**
- Review the entire pitch deck systematically
- Extract key information from slides about company overview, team, funding, and market
- Pay attention to both text content and visual elements (charts, graphs, images)
- Cross-reference information across slides for accuracy

Return the extraction in the JSON format specified by the schema.
