You are an expert at analyzing documentation and extracting executable commands. Your task is to analyze a README file and extract all ostruct commands that can be executed.

## README Content
{{ file_ref("readme_content") }}

## Example Directory
The commands in this README are located in: {{ safe_get("example_directory", "examples/unknown") }}

## Instructions

1. **Find all ostruct commands** in the README content above
2. **Normalize multi-line commands** - combine lines that use backslash continuation into single commands
3. **Resolve relative paths** - convert relative file paths to be relative to the example directory
4. **Identify dependencies** - list all files that each command requires
5. **Categorize commands** - determine if they're suitable for dry-run testing

## Command Analysis Rules

- Include ANY line that contains "ostruct" as a command (even if in explanatory text)
- For multi-line commands with backslashes (\), combine them into a single line
- **KEEP PATHS RELATIVE**: Do NOT convert relative paths - keep them as-is (e.g., "prompts/task.j2" stays "prompts/task.j2")
- The working_directory will be set to the example directory, so paths should be relative to that
- Identify all file dependencies (templates, schemas, input files)
- Mark commands as "executable" if they appear to be complete runnable examples
- Mark commands as "reference" if they appear to be partial or explanatory

## Output Requirements

Extract commands in the specified JSON schema format. For each command:
- `command`: The complete, normalized ostruct command
- `working_directory`: Where the command should be executed from
- `dependencies`: Array of file paths the command requires
- `type`: "executable" or "reference"
- `description`: Brief description of what the command does
- `original_text`: The original text from the README (for debugging)

## Context Information

- **README File**: {{ safe_get("readme_file", "unknown") }}
- **Example Directory**: {{ safe_get("example_directory", "examples/unknown") }}
- **Analysis Target**: Extract executable ostruct commands for validation testing

Focus on commands that appear to be complete, runnable examples rather than partial snippets or explanatory text.
