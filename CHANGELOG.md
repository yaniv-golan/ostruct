## [1.6.0] - 2025-08-02

### üí• BREAKING CHANGES

#### Code Interpreter Download Behavior Overhaul

- **File downloads now disabled by default** for Code Interpreter to optimize for the common use case (computation over file generation)
- **New `--ci-download` flag** provides explicit control over file downloads - add this flag when you need to save generated charts, reports, or data files locally
- **Deprecated `auto_download` config option** - use `--ci-download` CLI flag instead for clearer intent and better performance
- **Performance improvement**: Single-pass execution by default (~2-3s faster) with two-pass sentinel mode only when downloads are explicitly enabled
- **Migration required**: Existing commands that need file downloads must add `--ci-download` flag

**Migration Example:**

```bash
# OLD (files downloaded automatically)
ostruct run analysis.j2 schema.json --enable-tool code-interpreter

# NEW (explicit flag for file downloads)
ostruct run analysis.j2 schema.json --enable-tool code-interpreter --ci-download
```

See migration guide: `docs/migration/auto-download.md`

### Added

- **CLI**: New `--ci-download` flag for explicit Code Interpreter file download control
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive migration guide for `auto_download` ‚Üí `--ci-download` transition
- **Backward Compatibility**: Deprecation warnings for legacy `auto_download: true` config during transition period

#### üî¨ Data Science Integration Examples

- **Complete Example Suite**: New `examples/data-science/` directory with production-ready workflows:
  - **Analysis Pipeline**: CSV data processing with Code Interpreter integration (`examples/data-science/analysis/`)
  - **Market Entry Analysis**: Complex business analysis example with financial projections and regulatory data (`examples/data-science/integration/market-entry/`)
  - **Interactive Jupyter Integration**: Full `ostruct_data_analysis.ipynb` notebook with environment detection, experiment tracking, and chart display
  - **Self-Executing OST File**: `jupyter_integration.ost` for streamlined notebook integration
- **Development Infrastructure**: Makefiles, requirements files, and sample datasets for easy setup and testing
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive READMEs and integration guides for each example workflow

#### üõ†Ô∏è Dry-Run & API Key Validation Improvements

- **`--dry-run-json` UX Enhancement**: Flag now automatically enables dry-run mode - no need for redundant `--dry-run` flag

  ```bash
  # Before: ostruct run template.j2 schema.json --dry-run --dry-run-json
  # After:  ostruct run template.j2 schema.json --dry-run-json
  ```

- **API Key Validation in Dry-Run**: Dry-run mode now validates API key availability from all sources (CLI flag, environment variable, .env file)
- **Enhanced JSON Output**: `--dry-run-json` now includes `api_key_available` field for programmatic validation

#### üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Code Interpreter File Download Reliability

- **Model-Specific Instructions**: Automatically inject tailored prompts for different models (gpt-4.1, gpt-4o, o4-mini) to improve file annotation reliability
- **Raw HTTP Download Fallback**: Direct HTTP downloads for container files when SDK limitations prevent normal file access
- **Container Expiry Detection**: Proactive detection and handling of expired Code Interpreter containers
- **Enhanced Error Classification**: Detailed error types with user-friendly messages and actionable suggestions
- **Exponential Backoff Retry Logic**: Automatic retries for transient download failures with intelligent backoff
- **Progress Integration**: Download progress reporting integrated with existing `--progress` flag system
- **Schema Validation Warnings**: Automatic warnings when Code Interpreter is enabled but schema lacks text fields for download links

#### ü§ñ Intelligent Download Strategy Auto-Selection

- **Auto-Enable Two-Pass Sentinel**: ostruct now automatically enables the `two_pass_sentinel` download strategy when:
  - Code Interpreter is enabled
  - Structured output (JSON schema) is being used
  - `auto_download: true` (default)

  This works around a critical OpenAI API bug where structured output mode prevents file download annotations. The auto-enable behavior ensures files download successfully without manual configuration.

- **Smart Fallback Logic**: Users can still explicitly set `download_strategy: "single_pass"` in configuration to override the auto-enable behavior if needed.

#### üîß Developer Infrastructure

- **Comprehensive Testing Suite**: Mini-tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks for CI download reliability
- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed download attempt logging with credential sanitization

#### üõ†Ô∏è Code Interpreter Tool Enablement

- **Tool Choice Without Files**: Fixed critical bug where `--enable-tool code-interpreter` and `--tool-choice code-interpreter` would fail with "Tool choice not found in tools parameter" when no files were uploaded
- **File-Free Code Execution**: Code Interpreter can now be enabled for model-generated files without requiring input file uploads
- **Valid Use Cases Restored**:
  - `ostruct run template.j2 schema.json --enable-tool code-interpreter` - Let the model create files from scratch
  - `ostruct run template.j2 schema.json --tool-choice code-interpreter` - Force Code Interpreter usage for data generation
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing Code Interpreter workflows with file uploads continue to work unchanged

#### üîß MCP Server Configuration Validation

- **HTTP MCP Server Support**: Fixed validation error that prevented HTTP-based MCP servers from working with the `--mcp-server` flag

  - **STDIO format**: `{"name": "server-name", "command": "command-to-run"}` for local subprocess servers
  - **HTTP format**: `{"url": "https://server-url", "label": "optional-label"}` for remote HTTP/SSE servers
- **CLI Integration**: Resolved conflict between CLI MCP integration and service configuration validation systems
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing STDIO MCP server configurations continue to work unchanged

### Technical Notes

- **Workaround Implementation**: Enhanced download features implement automatic workarounds for the known OpenAI Responses API issue documented in `docs/known-issues/2025-06-responses-ci-file-output.md`
- **Future Removal**: Auto-enable logic will be removed when OpenAI resolves the underlying API bug
- **Performance Impact**: Two-pass execution and enhanced reliability features add ~2-3 seconds to structured output requests but ensure reliable file downloads

### Changed

- **Progress Options Simplification**: Merged `--no-progress` and `--progress-level` flags into a single `--progress [none|basic|detailed]` option for a cleaner, more intuitive CLI interface. This eliminates redundancy and follows standard CLI patterns where a single option controls related functionality.

- **Simplified CLI Syntax**: Updated all examples and documentation to use thes simplified attachment system with explicit file routing (`--file ci:`, `--dir fs:`, etc.) instead of legacy flags.

- **Comprehensive Error Categorization System**: Revolutionary error handling with intelligent categorization and solutions:
  - **13 Specific Error Categories**: FILE_FORMAT_ERROR, API_KEY_ERROR, SCHEMA_ERROR, TEMPLATE_ERROR, and 9 others for precise problem identification
  - **Actionable Solutions**: Each error provides primary and alternative solutions with corrected command examples
  - **Context-Aware Messaging**: Errors include relevant context (file paths, line numbers, configuration details) for faster troubleshooting

- **Streamlined Installation**: Removed complex installation script in favor of standard methods (pipx, Homebrew, Docker), with automated Homebrew formula updates on release.

- **MCP Environment Variables**: Changed MCP environment variable pattern from `MCP_<NAME>_URL` to `OSTRUCT_MCP_URL_<name>` for consistency with other ostruct environment variables (e.g., `OSTRUCT_MCP_URL_stripe` instead of `MCP_STRIPE_URL`). This provides better namespace isolation and follows the established `OSTRUCT_*` pattern used by other environment variables like `OSTRUCT_DISABLE_REGISTRY_UPDATE_CHECKS`.

- **YAML Frontmatter Configuration Updates**: Clarified configuration requirements for template frontmatter:
  - **Model and Temperature Restriction**: Model and temperature parameters must be specified via CLI flags (`--model gpt-4.1 --temperature 0.7`) and are not supported in YAML frontmatter
  - **System Prompt Support**: YAML frontmatter continues to support `system_prompt` and `include_system` configuration options
  - **Documentation Updates**: Updated all template documentation to reflect CLI-only requirement for model parameters
  - **Conflict Detection**: Added warning when both YAML frontmatter system_prompt and `--sys-file` are provided, with CLI taking precedence

- **Template Environment Variables**: Renamed template-specific environment variables for clarity:
  - `OSTRUCT_MAX_FILE_SIZE` ‚Üí `OSTRUCT_TEMPLATE_FILE_LIMIT` (controls individual file size limits for template access)
  - `OSTRUCT_MAX_TOTAL_SIZE` ‚Üí `OSTRUCT_TEMPLATE_TOTAL_LIMIT` (controls total file size limits for template processing)
  - `OSTRUCT_PREVIEW_LIMIT` ‚Üí `OSTRUCT_TEMPLATE_PREVIEW_LIMIT` (controls template debugging preview character limits)

  These variables only affect template file access (via `--file alias path`) and do not impact Code Interpreter (`--file ci:`) or File Search (`--file fs:`) file routing. The new names clearly indicate their template-specific scope.

### Fixed

- **Configuration and Test Reliability**: Resolved critical configuration and testing issues that were causing failures in CI/CD environments:
  - **Default Model Alignment**: Fixed test suite to properly expect `gpt-4.1` as the default model, ensuring consistency between code and tests

- **File Processing**: Resolved issues with file routing and processing, including proper handling of large files and elimination of inappropriate warnings for Code Interpreter and File Search usage.

- **Code Interpreter Downloads**: Significantly improved reliability of file downloads from Code Interpreter with robust fallback mechanisms and proper API integration.

- **Security Enhancements**: Multiple security improvements including:
  - Robust Azure endpoint validation using proper hostname parsing
  - Enhanced MCP response sanitization
  - Improved symlink security validation with resolved path checks
  - Better path traversal protection

- **CLI Consistency**: Updated argument handling throughout examples and scripts to use consistent simplified syntax, replacing deprecated flags like `--fta`, `--fca`, `-dc`, `-R` with current equivalents.

### Removed

- **Template Optimization System**: Completely removed the automatic template optimization system (1,104 lines of code) that had functional overlap with the new `file_ref()` mechanism. This includes:
  - Deleted `template_optimizer.py` module entirely
  - Removed `--no-optimization` CLI flag and related parameters
  - Eliminated automatic template content reorganization and appendix generation
  - Removed optimization-related debug capacities (`optimization`, `optimization-steps`)
  - Cleaned up optimization progress reporting and help text
  - Updated template debugging system to remove optimization-specific functions
  - The explicit `file_ref()` system provides cleaner, more predictable template organization

- **Legacy Flags**: Removed deprecated `--web-search` and `--no-web-search` flags in favor of universal `--enable-tool` and `--disable-tool` flags.

- **Streaming Support**: Removed unnecessary streaming support from OpenAI API calls to improve model compatibility (especially o3/o1 models) and reduce code complexity while maintaining identical user experience.

- **Placeholder Files**: Cleaned up dummy/placeholder files from examples that were causing build issues without providing value.

- **Quick Reference Command**: Removed `ostruct quick-ref` command in favor of the new `--quick-ref` flag, which provides the same functionality with enhanced rich formatting and better integration with the main CLI help system.

### Security

- **Enhanced Validation**: Strengthened security across multiple areas:
  - Improved Azure endpoint validation to prevent false positives
  - Enhanced MCP server response sanitization
  - Better symlink resolution and path validation
  - Robust dependency installation with proper error handling

### Migration Notes

For a comprehensive migration guide with examples and automated migration scripts, see [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](MIGRATION_GUIDE.md).

- **Template Optimization**: The automatic template optimization system has been removed. Users should migrate to the explicit `file_ref()` system:
  - Templates that relied on automatic optimization should now use `file_ref("alias")` for structured file references
  - The `--no-optimization` flag is no longer available (and no longer needed)
  - Template debugging capacities `optimization` and `optimization-steps` have been removed

- **File References**: Users can now choose between two approaches:
  - `file_ref("alias")` for automatic XML appendix generation (recommended for most use cases)
  - Direct file access with `{{ alias.content }}` for custom formatting needs

- **Template Debugging**: Replace old debug flags with new capacity-based system:
  - Old: `--debug-template --show-vars --show-preview`
  - New: `-t vars,preview` or `-t all`

- **CLI Syntax**: Update to simplified attachment syntax if still using legacy flags:
  - Old: `--fta alias file.txt`
  - New: `--file alias file.txt`

- **MCP Environment Variables**: Update your environment variable names:
  - Old: `MCP_STRIPE_URL=https://mcp.stripe.com`
  - New: `OSTRUCT_MCP_URL_stripe=https://mcp.stripe.com`
  - Old: `MCP_CUSTOM_URL=https://my-server.com`
  - New: `OSTRUCT_MCP_URL_custom=https://my-server.com`

- **Template Environment Variables**: Update template-specific environment variable names:
  - `OSTRUCT_MAX_FILE_SIZE` ‚Üí `OSTRUCT_TEMPLATE_FILE_LIMIT`
  - `OSTRUCT_MAX_TOTAL_SIZE` ‚Üí `OSTRUCT_TEMPLATE_TOTAL_LIMIT`
  - `OSTRUCT_PREVIEW_LIMIT` ‚Üí `OSTRUCT_TEMPLATE_PREVIEW_LIMIT`

  These variables control template file processing limits and do not affect Code Interpreter or File Search operations.

- **Quick Reference Access**: The `ostruct quick-ref` command has been replaced with the `--quick-ref` flag:
  - Old: `ostruct quick-ref`
  - New: `ostruct --quick-ref`

  The new flag provides the same reference information with enhanced rich formatting and better visual organization.

- **Documentation Improvements**: Revamped the `template_authoring.rst` guide to use the new, canonical script invocation patterns and variable naming conventions.
- **File Path Handling**: The `FileInfo.path` property now correctly returns absolute paths for files located outside the project's base directory, as long as they are within a directory explicitly allowed by the security manager.

### Fixed

- **System Prompt Errors**: Correctly initialized `SystemPromptError` to ensure it captures and reports errors related to system prompt processing properly.

## [0.8.8] - 2025-06-06

### Changed

- **Installation Script Distribution**: Updated all documentation to use `latest` release URL (`https://github.com/yaniv-golan/ostruct/releases/latest/download/install-macos.sh`) instead of version-specific URLs for future-proof installation instructions.
- **macOS Installation Script**: Added dynamic Python version fetching using endoflife.date API
  - Eliminates hardcoded Python URLs that require manual maintenance

- **Python Installation**: Improved Python.org installer with version tracking, better error messages, and guidance for manual updates.

## [0.8.7] - 2025-06-06

### Fixed

- **Installation Script Build**: Fixed build script to create required directories during GitHub Actions workflow. The macOS installation script is now properly generated and available as a release asset.

## [0.8.6] - 2025-06-06

### Changed

- **Installation Script Distribution**: Modified GitHub Actions publish workflow to upload macOS installation script as release asset instead of committing to repository. Installation URL changed from raw GitHub URL to release asset: `https://github.com/yaniv-golan/ostruct/releases/download/v{VERSION}/install-macos.sh`

## [0.8.5] - 2025-06-06

### Added

- **macOS Installation Script**: Added comprehensive installation script with dynamic version management and industry-standard organization. The script automatically handles Python installation, PATH configuration, and ostruct setup on macOS. Features include Python 3.10+ installation via Homebrew or python.org, shell PATH configuration, pip cache clearing, and version verification. The script uses a template-based build system that automatically extracts the current version from `pyproject.toml`. Scripts are organized following industry best practices with separate directories for build automation, platform-specific installation, and categorized testing (unit/integration/docker). Users can install with: `curl -sSL https://github.com/yaniv-golan/ostruct/releases/latest/download/install-macos.sh | bash`

- **Centralized Dependency Installation Utilities**: Added comprehensive dependency management system in `scripts/install/dependencies/` with reusable utilities for installing common tools across examples. Features include `ensure_jq.sh` and `ensure_mermaid.sh` with multiple installation strategies (system package managers, direct binary downloads, Docker wrappers), cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows), environment variable controls (`OSTRUCT_SKIP_AUTO_INSTALL`, `OSTRUCT_PREFER_DOCKER`), and comprehensive testing framework. This eliminates code duplication across examples and provides consistent, reliable tool installation.

- **Enhanced Argument Interchange Format (AIF) Support**: Major enhancement to the `arg_to_aif` example with a complete AIF extension system for advanced argument visualization. Features include:
  - **AIF Extension System**: Backward-compatible extensions with semantic categories (premise, evidence, conclusion, inference, conflict), relationship types (supports, conflicts, infers, attacks, relates), and display names for compact visualization
  - **Advanced Mermaid Visualization**: Color-coded diagrams with semantic node styling, enhanced edge labels showing argument relationships, smaller fonts allowing 80 characters per node, and automatic SVG generation
  - **Enhanced Prompt Engineering**: Balanced prompt for complex academic arguments, explicit node-type guidance, proper use of all AIF node types (I, RA, CA, PA, MA), and support for 20-35 node structures for academic texts
  - **Model Parameter Support**: Configurable model selection with GPT-4.1 default for sophisticated reasoning
  - **Comprehensive Documentation**: Complete AIF extension specification in `AIF_EXTENSIONS.md` with usage examples and compatibility guidelines

- **Multi-Agent Debate Citation Enhancement**: Enhanced the multi-agent debate example with smart citation post-processing that automatically converts any AI citation format to clean academic-style numbered references. Features include:
  - **Smart Citation Processing**: Extracts inline citations from debate text and converts them to numbered references [1], [2], [3]
  - **URL Parameter Handling**: Flexible URL matching that handles query parameters (e.g., `?utm_source=openai`) for reliable citation identification
  - **Title Enhancement**: Merges inline citation positioning with structured citation metadata to provide meaningful titles instead of bare domain names
  - **Perfect Correspondence**: Maintains 1:1 correspondence between text references and citation list for clean, academic-style presentation
  - **Cross-Format Compatibility**: Works with any AI citation format, making debates more readable for technical audiences

- **Multi-Agent Debate GPT-4.1 Upgrade**: Upgraded the multi-agent debate example to use GPT-4.1 as the default model, providing 1M+ context window (vs 128k for GPT-4o), 32k max output (vs 16k), and enhanced reasoning capabilities for more sophisticated debate quality and handling of larger, more complex discussions.

- **Professional Build System**: Implemented comprehensive build automation and testing infrastructure:
  - **Makefile Integration**: Added dependency testing targets to main Makefile with `test-dependencies` for automated validation
  - **Cross-Platform Scripts**: Organized script structure with platform-specific installation, build automation, and categorized testing (unit/integration/docker)
  - **Template-Based Build System**: Dynamic version management that automatically extracts current version from `pyproject.toml`

### Changed

- **Dependency Management**: Migrated from scattered `ensure_*.sh` scripts across examples to centralized utilities in `scripts/install/dependencies/`. Examples now source shared utilities instead of maintaining duplicate installation logic, reducing maintenance overhead and ensuring consistency.

- **Documentation Structure**: Added `DEPENDENCY_UTILITIES.md` (renamed from `DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT.md`) with comprehensive documentation for the new dependency installation system, including usage patterns, environment variables, and testing procedures.

### Fixed

- **Code Duplication**: Eliminated duplicate dependency installation scripts across examples (removed `examples/multi_agent_debate/scripts/ensure_*.sh` files) in favor of centralized utilities.

- **Build System Organization**: Restructured scripts directory following industry best practices with separate directories for build automation (`scripts/build/`), platform-specific installation (`scripts/install/`), and categorized testing (`scripts/test/`).

### Security

- **Dependency Installation**: Enhanced security in dependency installation utilities with proper error handling, validation of download sources, and fallback mechanisms to prevent installation of compromised tools.

## [0.8.4] - 2025-06-05

### Added

- **Environment File Support**: Added automatic loading of `.env` files from the current directory. Environment variables defined in `.env` files are automatically loaded at startup, with command-line environment variables taking precedence over `.env` file values. This provides a convenient way to manage API keys and configuration without exposing them in command history or process lists.

### Changed

- **Simplified Timeout Parameters**: Streamlined timeout handling to use a single `--timeout` parameter for OpenAI API calls (default: 60 seconds). Removed the complex dual timeout system that previously caused parameter conflicts and user confusion. The CLI now has cleaner, more intuitive timeout behavior.

## [0.8.3] - 2025-06-05

### Added

- **Universal Tool Toggle Flags**: Added `--enable-tool` and `--disable-tool` CLI flags for controlling tool enablement across all built-in tools (code-interpreter, web-search, file-search, mcp). These flags are repeatable, take highest precedence over all other configuration methods, and work for the current run only. Example: `--enable-tool web-search --disable-tool code-interpreter`. Conflicts between enabling and disabling the same tool are detected and reported as errors.
- **Feature Flags**: Added `--enable-feature` and `--disable-feature` CLI flags for experimental features. Currently supports `ci-download-hack` to enable/disable the Code Interpreter file download workaround on a per-run basis, overriding configuration file settings.
- **Multi-Agent Debate Example**: Added comprehensive multi-agent evidence-seeking debate example in `examples/multi_agent_debate/` demonstrating structured debates between PRO and CON agents with web search integration. Features include command-line topic arguments, self-installing dependencies (jq, Mermaid CLI), dual visualizations (interactive HTML + colorful SVG diagrams), color-coded agents and relationships, topic-centered diagram flow, and clean file organization. Showcases ostruct's latest CLI syntax, JSON schema validation, and cross-platform auto-installation capabilities.
- **Improved File Processing**: Enhanced file routing to eliminate inappropriate large file warnings when using Code Interpreter (`-fc`, `--fca`) and File Search (`-fs`, `--fsa`) flags. Large file warnings now only appear for template-only files where they're actually relevant. Also fixed duplicate file mapping errors when the same file is processed multiple times.
- **Reliable Code Interpreter File Downloads**: Significantly improved file download reliability for Code Interpreter workflows. Files generated by Code Interpreter are now automatically detected and downloaded using OpenAI's latest API format, with robust fallback mechanisms to ensure downloads work consistently across different scenarios.

### Deprecated

- **Tool Enablement Flags**: The `--web-search` and `--no-web-search` flags are now deprecated in favor of the universal `--enable-tool web-search` and `--disable-tool web-search` flags. The old flags will be removed in v0.9.0. Deprecation warnings are shown when the old flags are used.

### Fixed

- **Template Optimization Bug**: Fixed template optimizer incorrectly processing single-file variables accessed via `.content` (e.g., `{{ argument_text.content }}`) as directory references, which caused them to be replaced with "the files and subdirectories in <dir:variable>" instead of actual file content. The `--fta` flag now works correctly for any alias name, not just those containing specific keywords like "file" or "config". This resolves issues where custom variable names would be misprocessed during template optimization.
- **Code Interpreter File Downloads**: Fixed Code Interpreter file downloads to work with OpenAI's structured output mode. Implemented a two-pass sentinel workaround for OpenAI's bug where `response_format` with JSON schema prevents `container_file_citation` annotations, blocking file downloads. The solution uses a configurable two-pass execution strategy: (1) raw API call without structured output to generate files and annotations, (2) download files using the Container Files API, (3) extract JSON from sentinel markers for schema compliance. Added `download_strategy` configuration option (default: "single_pass" for backward compatibility, "two_pass_sentinel" to enable the workaround). Implemented robust Container Files API integration with dual-approach strategy (primary: `client.containers.files.content()`, fallback: raw HTTP requests) to handle OpenAI SDK variations. Files generated by Code Interpreter are now reliably downloaded across all models when using structured output mode. CLI flags `--enable-feature ci-download-hack` and `--disable-feature ci-download-hack` provide per-run control over this workaround.
- **File Routing Intent Bug**: Fixed incorrect large file warnings for Code Interpreter and File Search files. Also fixed duplicate file mapping error that occurred when the same file was processed twice from both CLI args and routing result by adding proper deduplication logic.
- **Template Error Messages**: Fixed issue where internal class names like `ostruct.cli.file_list.FileInfoList` were appearing in user-facing template error messages. Error messages now properly extract variable names from Jinja2 errors and provide clean, actionable feedback.
- **Large File Warning Timing**: Fixed large file warnings to trigger when file content is actually accessed (via `.content` property) rather than during FileInfo initialization, ensuring warnings appear at the appropriate time and are properly captured by test frameworks.
- **Streaming Support Removal**: Removed unnecessary streaming support from OpenAI API calls to improve model compatibility (especially o3/o1 models) and reduce code complexity. The streaming implementation provided no user benefits since all responses were buffered anyway, but created compatibility issues with newer models. This change eliminates ~300 lines of complex chunk processing code while maintaining identical user experience and improving reliability. All functionality is preserved with simplified non-streaming API calls.
- **Error Handling Display**: Fixed error handling logic that was showing Python tracebacks for user input errors (schema validation, JSON parsing, etc.). User-facing errors now display clean, actionable messages without technical stack traces, while preserving detailed logging for debugging with `--verbose` flag.

## [0.8.2] - 2025-06-01

### Fixed

- **Documentation Accuracy**: Audit and correction of all documentation files to ensure they accurately reflect the actual codebase implementation
- **Style Guide**: Updated coding standards to match actual project configuration (Black line-length 79 vs documented 88, correct error class names, actual API patterns)
- **CLI Examples**: Fixed several CLI syntax examples throughout documentation to use correct flag syntax (--fta instead of incorrect -ft two-argument usage)
- **API Documentation**: Corrected mocking examples to use OpenAI Responses API instead of Completions API, matching actual ostruct implementation
- **Cross-References**: Fixed broken documentation cross-references and removed references to non-existent files
- **Sphinx Warnings**: Resolved all Sphinx build warnings including title underline length issues
- **Code Examples**: Updated all code examples to use the updated classes, functions, and import paths from the codebase

## [0.8.1] - 2025-06-01

### Added

- **Web Search Integration**: Added documentation for web search functionality across all relevant documentation files
- **Examples**: Linked docs to existing web-search example to demonstrate real-time information retrieval capabilities

### Fixed

- **Documentation Build**: Fixed Read the Docs configuration to use `pip install -e ".[docs]"` instead of `poetry install --with docs` to properly install documentation dependencies from `pyproject.toml` optional-dependencies format
- **Documentation**: Updated all multi-tool integration references to include Web Search alongside Code Interpreter, File Search, and MCP servers
- **CLI Reference**: Added Web Search integration section with usage examples and privacy notices
- **Quick Reference**: Added web search tool and example to quick reference command

## [0.8.0] - 2025-06-01

### Added

- **Multi-Tool Integration**:
  - Introduced explicit file routing options (`-ft`, `-fc`, `-fs`, `--fta`, `--fca`, `--fsa`, `-dt`, `-dc`, `-ds`, `--dta`, `--dca`, `--dsa`) to direct files to specific tools: template context, Code Interpreter, or File Search. This provides granular control over file processing and data flow, especially concerning uploads to external services.
  - Added the `--file-for TOOL PATH` option (repeatable), enabling a file to be routed to a specific tool. To route one file to multiple tools, repeat the flag (e.g., `--file-for code-interpreter shared.json --file-for file-search shared.json`).
  - Enhanced template context to include tool-specific file objects (e.g., `code_interpreter_files`, `file_search_files_raw`) providing metadata about files processed by these tools.

- **Code Interpreter Integration**:
  - Integrated native support for OpenAI\'s Code Interpreter, allowing for Python code execution, data analysis, and visualization generation within ostruct workflows.
  - New CLI options for Code Interpreter: `--file-for-code-interpreter` (`-fc`), `--file-for-code-interpreter-alias` (`--fca`), `--dir-for-code-interpreter` (`-dc`), `--dir-for-code-interpreter-alias` (`--dca`), `--code-interpreter-cleanup` (default: true), and `--code-interpreter-download-dir`.
  - Core logic implemented in `src/ostruct/cli/code_interpreter.py`.

- **File Search Integration**:
  - Integrated native support for OpenAI\'s File Search, enabling vector-based semantic search and retrieval over user-provided documents.
  - New CLI options for File Search: `--file-for-search` (`-fs`), `--file-for-search-alias` (`--fsa`), `--dir-for-search` (`-ds`), `--dir-for-search-alias` (`--dsa`), `--file-search-cleanup` (default: true), `--file-search-vector-store-name`, `--file-search-retry-count`, and `--file-search-timeout`.
  - Core logic implemented in `src/ostruct/cli/file_search.py`.

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration**:
  - Added support for connecting to external Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, allowing ostruct to leverage specialized external tools and knowledge bases.
  - New CLI options for MCP: `--mcp-server`, `--mcp-allowed-tools`, `--mcp-require-approval`, and `--mcp-headers` for authentication and custom request parameters.
  - Core logic implemented in `src/ostruct/cli/mcp_integration.py`.

- **Configuration System**:
  - Introduced a YAML-based configuration file (default: `ostruct.yaml` in the current directory or `~/.ostruct/config.yaml`, or a path specified by `--config`) for persistent settings related to models, tools, operational parameters, and cost limits.
  - Implemented direct loading of specific environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OSTRUCT_MCP_URL_<name>`) within the configuration system. Generic `${ENV_VAR}` style substitution within the YAML is not supported.
  - New CLI option: `--config` to specify a custom configuration file path.

- **Progress Reporting**:
  - Implemented real-time, granular progress indicators for long-running operations such as file processing, API interactions, and tool executions, enhancing user experience for complex tasks.
  - New CLI options: `--progress-level` (options: none, basic, detailed) and `--no-progress` to control the verbosity of progress updates.
  - Core logic implemented in `src/ostruct/cli/progress_reporting.py`.

- **Cost Estimation and Control**:
  - Integrated token usage estimation based on `tiktoken` and model-specific pricing for OpenAI API calls.
  - The `--dry-run` option has been enhanced to display estimated token counts and approximate costs without making actual API calls.
  - Introduced configuration options in `ostruct.yaml` for `max_cost_per_run` (to fail operations exceeding a budget) and `warn_expensive_operations` (to alert users).
  - Core logic implemented in `src/ostruct/cli/cost_estimation.py`.

- **Security Enhancements**:
  - Path Security: Strengthened file access controls through the `SecurityManager`. This includes mandatory validation of paths against explicitly allowed directories (specified via `-A`, `--allow`, or `--allowed-dir-file`) and a configurable base directory (`--base-dir`) for resolving relative paths.
  - Symlink Resolution: Improved and safer symlink handling within `SecurityManager` to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities by resolving symlinks to their canonical paths before validation.
  - Tool-Specific File Routing: Enforced strict file routing, requiring users to explicitly designate files for Code Interpreter or File Search. This prevents accidental uploading of sensitive files intended only for local template processing.
  - MCP Security: Added validation for MCP server URLs (requiring HTTPS) and mechanisms for approval (`--mcp-require-approval`) and secure authentication via custom headers (`--mcp-headers`) when connecting to external MCP services.

- **Template Filters and Globals**:
  - Added a comprehensive suite of new Jinja2 filters for advanced text manipulation (e.g., `word_count`, `char_count`, `remove_comments`, `strip_markdown`, `wrap`), data processing (e.g., `to_json`, `from_json`, `sort_by`, `group_by`, `unique`, `single`), table formatting (`table`, `dict_to_table`), and code processing (e.g., `format_code`, `strip_comments`).
  - Introduced new Jinja2 global functions for utility tasks such as `estimate_tokens`, `now` (current datetime), `validate_json`, `summarize`, and `pivot_table`.

- **CLI Improvements**:
  - Enhanced `--help` output across commands for improved clarity, providing better descriptions and examples for the new, extensive options.
  - Introduced the `ostruct quick-ref` command, offering users a concise summary of the new file routing options and their syntaxes.
  - Added new utility commands: `ostruct list-models` to display available OpenAI models from the registry and `ostruct update-registry` to refresh the local model registry.
  - Improved error handling with more specific error messages and standardized exit codes, providing better context for troubleshooting and integration into automated workflows.
  - Added new debugging options: `--debug-validation` (for detailed schema validation errors) and `--debug-openai-stream` (for inspecting raw OpenAI API stream data).
  - Comprehensive template debugging infrastructure (`--debug-template`, `--show-templates`, etc.).
  - `OSTRUCT_DISABLE_REGISTRY_UPDATE_CHECKS` environment variable to control update notifications.

- **Documentation**:
  - Developed comprehensive user guides covering new features, including an updated CLI reference, guides for tool integration (Code Interpreter, File Search, MCP), security best practices, CI/CD automation patterns, and containerization.
  - Added a rich set of examples in the `examples/` directory, demonstrating practical use cases for the new multi-tool capabilities, configuration system, and advanced CLI options.
  - Meta-Schema Generator example for automated JSON schema creation.

- **Template System**:
  - Template Optimization: Automatic prompt optimization for better LLM performance.
  - Shared System Prompts: New `include_system:` feature for sharing common system prompt content.

- **File Handling**:
  - Binary File Handling: Restored lazy loading for binary files in dry-run.
  - Windows Compatibility: Enhanced file routing for Windows.

- **Token Management**:
  - Added 90% token usage warning threshold.

### Changed

- **File Routing (Critical Change)**: The legacy file input flags (`-f`, `-d`, `-p`) are now considered aliases, primarily for template-only access (equivalent to `-ft`, `-dt`). While backward compatibility is maintained, users are **strongly encouraged** to adopt the new explicit routing flags (e.g., `-ft`, `-fc`, `-fs`, and their directory/alias counterparts like `--fca`, `-ds`) for clarity, security, and to leverage new tool integrations. This change is fundamental to how ostruct handles files, especially concerning data uploads to OpenAI services.
- **Default Model**: The default OpenAI model has been updated to `gpt-4o`.
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error messages and exit codes across the application to provide more consistent and actionable feedback for users and automation scripts. Enhanced error messages provide actionable file routing guidance.
- **Logging**: Enhanced logging capabilities with more granular control. Verbose logging now offers deeper insights into internal operations and API interactions.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Removed `openai-structured` dependency in favor of direct OpenAI SDK integration (`openai==1.81.0`).
  - Updated `tiktoken` (to `v0.9.0`) and `openai-model-registry` (to `v0.7.0`).
  - Introduced new dependencies such as `aiohttp` and `python-magic`.
- **Project Structure**: Reorganized the `src/ostruct/cli/` directory into a more modular structure, with dedicated subdirectories for commands and security, and new modules for each major feature.
- **Schema Validation**: Schema validation against the provided JSON Schema is now more aligned with OpenAI\'s specific requirements for structured outputs, such as enforcing a root object type and `additionalProperties: false`.
- **Template Context**: Template context now includes files from all routing options.

### Fixed

- **Critical**: Resolved Click framework limitations for variable argument file routing.
- **Critical**: Fixed template variable collision issues with comprehensive file naming.
- **Critical**: Resolved directory routing design flaw - generic templates can now use stable variable names with directory alias syntax.
- **Critical**: Made `FileInfoList` scalar properties (`.content`, `.path`, `.abs_path`, `.size`, `.name`) strict single-file only, raising `ValueError` for multiple files. **Migration required**: Use `.names` for lists, iterate, or use `|single` filter.
- Improved handling of large template files, reducing the likelihood of exceeding token limits by more efficient internal processing.
- Enhanced input validation for various CLI arguments, providing clearer error messages for incorrect usage.
- Addressed issues related to special characters in file paths causing errors on certain operating systems.
- Refined logging mechanisms for API calls to aid in debugging.
- Corrected path traversal detection in Unicode safety patterns to correctly handle valid filenames that contain multiple dots, while still preventing malicious inputs.
- Fixed whitespace handling in variable (`-V`) and JSON variable (`-J`) validators.
- Resolved a potential infinite recursion issue within the `PathSecurityError.details` property getter.
- Restored binary-safe lazy loading to prevent unnecessary content loading during dry-run.
- Enhanced file routing with better error handling and validation.
- Improved template variable optimization with proper file attribute references.
- Standardized Python version requirements across CI/CD (Python 3.10+).

### Removed

- The `ostruct init` command has been deprecated and removed. Project initialization is now achieved through manual creation of template/schema files and the optional `ostruct.yaml` configuration file.
- Implicit file routing behaviors have been removed. Files intended for Code Interpreter or File Search must now be explicitly routed using the appropriate flags (e.g., `-fc`, `-fs`). This change enhances security by preventing unintentional data uploads.
- The `--verbose-schema` option has been removed. Detailed schema validation information is now part of the `--debug-validation` output.
- The generic directory extension flag `--ext` has been renamed to `--dir-ext` to clarify its application to directory processing only.

### Security

- Enhanced overall path security with more comprehensive validation logic within the `SecurityManager`, including stricter checks for allowed directories and base path resolution.
- Improved prevention of directory traversal attacks through robust path normalization and safe joining utilities.
- Strengthened symlink resolution mechanisms to detect and block potentially malicious symlinks pointing outside of allowed areas.
- Introduced explicit CLI flags for routing files to external services (Code Interpreter, File Search), ensuring users make conscious decisions about data uploads and reducing the risk of accidental data exposure.
- Added security considerations for MCP server integration, including support for custom headers (e.g., for API keys/Bearer tokens) and controls for restricting allowed tools per server (`--mcp-allowed-tools`, `--mcp-require-approval`).

### Migration Notes

- **FileInfoList API**: The `.content`, `.path`, `.name`, etc. properties on `FileInfoList` objects are now strict single-file only. Accessing them on a list with multiple files will raise a `ValueError`.
  - To get a list of names: `{{ my_files.names }}`
  - To access content of the first file: `{{ my_files[0].content }}`
  - To ensure a single file and get its content: `{{ (my_files|single).content }}`
- **CLI `--file-for` syntax**: Changed from `tool:path` to `tool path` for Windows compatibility.
- **Dependencies**: `openai-structured` has been removed.

## [3.2.0] - 2025-01-01

### üö® BREAKING CHANGES

#### Template File Size Limits

- **Changed default behavior**: `OSTRUCT_TEMPLATE_FILE_LIMIT` now defaults to **unlimited** (was 64KB)
- **Reason**: The 64KB limit was artificially restricting template processing and preventing users from taking full advantage of large context windows
- **Migration**: If you need the old 64KB limit, set `OSTRUCT_TEMPLATE_FILE_LIMIT=65536` in your environment or config

### Added

- **Enhanced file size configuration**:
  - `--max-file-size` CLI option with support for size suffixes (KB, MB, GB)
  - Support for semantic values: `unlimited`, `none`, empty string for no limit
  - Configurable limits via CLI args, environment variables, and config files
  - Early validation in dry-run mode

- **Improved template tool integration**:
  - Automatic `file_search_enabled` variable detection
  - Enhanced AIF template with conditional multi-tool instructions
  - Better variable naming: `argument_file` (clearer than `argument_text`)
  - Smart content access for large documents

- **Better error handling**:
  - Clear warning messages for files exceeding limits
  - Graceful degradation with lazy loading
  - Informative error messages with suggested solutions

### Changed

- **Template processing**: Now supports unlimited file sizes by default
- **File size validation**: Enhanced to handle `None` values (unlimited)
- **Environment variable behavior**: `OSTRUCT_TEMPLATE_FILE_LIMIT` supports new semantic values

### Fixed

- **Large document processing**: Files over 64KB can now be processed directly
- **Tool variable detection**: `file_search_enabled` now properly set based on routing
- **Configuration consistency**: All file size settings now use consistent `None` for unlimited

### Technical Details

#### Core Changes

1. **LazyFileContent**: Enhanced `_get_default_max_size()` to return `None` by default
2. **Template Processor**: Added `file_search_enabled` to `_build_tool_context()`
3. **File Size Validator**: Updated to handle `None` values properly
4. **CLI Integration**: Added `--max-file-size` parameter with validation

#### Backward Compatibility

- Existing templates continue to work unchanged
- Legacy environment variable values still supported
- Graceful handling of invalid configuration values

#### Migration Examples

```bash
# Before (would fail for large files)
ostruct run template.j2 schema.json --file data large_document.pdf
# Error: File too large: 444,416 bytes > 65,536 bytes

# After (works by default)
ostruct run template.j2 schema.json --file data large_document.pdf
# ‚úÖ Processes successfully

# To restore old behavior
OSTRUCT_TEMPLATE_FILE_LIMIT=65536 ostruct run template.j2 schema.json --file data document.pdf

# Or use CLI option
ostruct run template.j2 schema.json --file data document.pdf --max-file-size 64KB
```
