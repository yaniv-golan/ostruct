and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.0] - Unreleased

### Added

- Added support for o1 and o3 models with their specific parameter constraints.
- Added validation to prevent use of unsupported parameters for each model type.
- Added explicit type casting for Click commands with improved type hints.
- Added integration with `openai-structured v2.0.0` and its `openai_structured.model_registry` for better model capability management.
- Added more comprehensive test coverage for model validation and type safety.

### Changed

- **Major change to CLI structure:** Introduced the `run` subcommand.  The CLI no longer uses a single command format; instead, it's structured as `ostruct run <TASK_TEMPLATE> <SCHEMA_FILE> [OPTIONS]`. This provides better organization and extensibility.
- Enhanced parameter validation to ensure compliance with model-specific requirements.
- Changed default model to `gpt-4o`.
- Changed default temperature from 0.0 to 0.7.
- Upgraded minimum Python version requirement from 3.9 to 3.10.
- Updated MyPy configuration with more specific settings for different modules.
- Improved type safety throughout the codebase with `ParamSpec` and better type hints.
- Moved CLI command definition outside the `create_cli` function for better organization.
- Improved error messages for model parameter validation.
- Enhanced test infrastructure with better OpenAI test isolation.
- Improved error handling with consistent use of `ExitCode` enum.
- Improved handling of paths (relative to security manager's base directory).
- Changed the command-line options to use Click's option naming convention:
  - `--task-file` instead of using positional argument or `@` syntax.
  - `--schema-file` instead of using positional argument.
  - `--file name=path` now uses  `-f name path`
  - `--dir name=path` now uses `-d name path`
  - `--files name=pattern` now uses `-p name pattern`
  - `--dir-recursive` is now `-R` or `--recursive`
  - `--var name=value` is now `-V name=value`
  - `--json-var name=json` is now `-J name='json'`
  - `--system-prompt` is now `--sys-prompt`
  - `--system-prompt-file` is now `--sys-file`
  - `--ignore-task-sysprompt` is now `--ignore-task-sysprompt`
  - `--max-output-tokens` is now `--max-output-tokens`
  - `--verbose-schema` is removed. Schema is always validated. Validation details are now shown with `--debug-validation`.
  - `--ext` is renamed to `--dir-ext`, applying only to directory mappings.

### Fixed

- Fixed handling of model parameter validation to properly check supported parameters and their constraints.
- Removed duplicate `system_prompt` option from model_options to prevent conflicts.
- Fixed duplicate `mock_model_support` fixture in tests.
- Improved type checking and error messages in security-related tests.
- Enhanced `Path` object handling and type hints in test utilities.
- Fixed handling of fixed parameter models to completely prevent parameter overrides instead of trying to validate them.
- Fixed handling of `Path` objects in `safe_join` by converting them to strings.
- Fixed security error message formatting for better clarity.
- Fixed path handling inconsistencies in file collection utilities.

### Removed

- Removed has_fixed_parameters function and related tests as this concept is now handled by the model registry.
- Removed redundant test cases for stdin and directory input.
- Removed direct model parameter checks in favor of `ModelRegistry` usage.

### Security

- Enhanced path security checks with more comprehensive validation.
- Improved directory traversal prevention.
- Added more detailed security error messages with context.
- Enhanced validation of allowed directories and base paths.
